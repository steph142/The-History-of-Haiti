    <h2>Haiti American- a Personal Story</h2>
    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
    <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="info" -->
    <p>Growing up as a Haitian American was a random time. Being from Florida and growing up in the early 2000s, many people didn’t know about Haiti or Haitians. We were pushed to the side after all the history and revolution Haiti has done and gone through. Haiti didn’t get recognized until 2010 when the earthquake struck and the whole world was talking about it. It was a scary and strange time because this was my first time hearing people talk about Haiti and knowing that it exists, but it also was scary because of the situation. I didn’t know many of the family members that were in Haiti at the time so I couldn’t relate as much pain and worry as many of my other family members felt, but I knew it was bad. As the exposure of Haiti grew so did the stereotypes and mean/insensitive comments come. I, like many other Haitian Americans, have gone through this most notably in middle school. Haitians were talked down on and we didn’t know why. This treatment has since died down as many of us Haitian Americans start to not only embrace our culture but also stand up for it and each other. Over the years, more and more people now know about Haiti's culture and people and are embracing it even more. I am glad that Haiti is finally getting the respect that it deserves, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
